  # Multiverse's Lowest LO-FI Wood Pixel Displayâ€”Arduino Art 
  Lowest LOFI display in the known 10 hyper dimensional multiverse, that I've seen.  Wood based tech art.

  This code was written to power the WTD 1.0 (Wood Tile Display) project 
  created while participating in Mark Rober's 
  https://monthly.com/mark-rober-engineering course.
  

  Cheers!

  ## Code
  [src/wtd_1/wtd_1.ino](src/wtd_1/wtd_1.ino)
  - Displays Wave pattern by default.  Pause/Resume by sending "1" via Serial Monitor.  Edit _mode to change default start mode.

  ## Model .STL file
  [SG90 Arm Angle 10.stl](models/SG90%20Arm%20Angle%2010.stl)
  <!-- https://github.com/aaronse/ServoPixelDisplay/blob/main/models/SG90%20Arm%20Angle%2010.stl -->
  
  ## Build

  Backside view of the rats nest wiring.  Note the WAGO connectors, 16awg for power, and skinny wiring for data lines.  v1.0 was (under) powered by a 5v 5amp Alitov power adapter.
